## üìã Detailed Task Breakdown

### 1. Struct Support Implementation

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/Pible/Lexer.zig`: Add struct keyword recognition
- `src/Pible/Parser.zig`: Implement struct parsing logic
- `src/Pible/CodeGen.zig`: Generate BPF code for struct operations
- `tests/parser_test.zig`: Add struct parsing tests

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add `struct` keyword to lexer token types
2. Create AST nodes for struct definitions and member access
3. Implement struct field offset calculation
4. Generate BPF instructions for struct member access
5. Add comprehensive tests

**Example Target Syntax**:
```c
struct Point {
    U64 x;
    U64 y;
};

U0 main() {
    struct Point p;
    p.x = 10;
    p.y = 20;
    PrintF("Point: (%d, %d)\n", p.x, p.y);
}
```

### 2. VS Code Extension Development

**Directory Structure**:
```
tools/vscode-extension/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ language-server.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ syntaxes/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ holyc.tmLanguage.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ snippets/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ holyc.json
```

**Features to Implement**:
- Syntax highlighting based on TextMate grammar
- Code snippets for common HolyC patterns
- Basic error squiggles from compiler output
- Hover tooltips for built-in functions

### 3. Enhanced Error Reporting

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Add source location tracking to all AST nodes
2. Create error context with line/column information
3. Implement colored terminal output
4. Add "did you mean?" suggestions for common typos

**Example Error Output**:
```
Error in main.hc:5:12
  |
5 | U64 x = undefined_var;
  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ undefined variable 'undefined_var'
  |
  = help: did you mean 'undefined_value'?
```

### 4. Package Manager Design

**Package Configuration (`package.hc`)**:
```holyc
package "my-defi-app" {
    version = "1.0.0";
    author = "Developer Name";
    license = "MIT";
    
    dependencies = {
        "solana-sdk" = "^1.0.0",
        "math-utils" = "0.5.2"
    };
    
    targets = ["solana-bpf", "linux-bpf"];
}
```

**Registry Structure**:
- Central package registry with Git-based versioning
- Package validation and security scanning
- Dependency resolution with version constraints
- Local package cache for faster builds

### 5. Solana BPF Enhancements

**Account Handling**:
```c
// New account manipulation syntax
Account* token_account = get_account(accounts, 0);
require(token_account->owner == TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, "Invalid owner");

// Automatic serialization/deserialization
struct TokenAccount token_data;
deserialize_account(token_account, &token_data);
```

**CPI Support**:
```c
// Cross-program invocation helper
invoke_program(
    TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
    transfer_instruction(from, to, amount),
    &[from_account, to_account]
);
```

## üîÑ Development Workflow
