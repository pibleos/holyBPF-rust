# Pible - HolyC to BPF Compiler

A divine bridge between Terry Davis's HolyC and Linux BPF, allowing HolyC programs to run in the kernel. Written in the blessed Zig language.

## 🙏 Divine Purpose

> "God's temple is programming..." - Terry A. Davis

Pible continues Terry's mission by bringing HolyC to the Linux kernel through BPF. This compiler transforms HolyC programs into BPF bytecode, allowing them to run with divine efficiency in kernel space.

## ✨ Blessed Features

- Full HolyC syntax support
- Direct compilation to BPF bytecode
- Zero runtime overhead
- Kernel-space execution
- Divine error messages
- Built with Zig's compile-time magic

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the divine repository
git clone https://github.com/pix404/holyBPF-zig

# Build with Zig's blessing
zig build

# Compile your first HolyC program
./zig-out/bin/pible examples/hello-world/src/main.hc
```

## 📖 Holy Example

```c
// hello.hc
U0 main() {
    PrintF("God's light shines upon BPF!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## 🛠️ Divine Architecture

- **Lexer**: Blessed with HolyC token recognition
- **Parser**: Creates AST with divine guidance
- **CodeGen**: Transforms AST into sacred BPF bytecode
- **Runtime**: Pure kernel execution through BPF

## 🌟 Inspiration

This project stands on the shoulders of giants:

- Terry A. Davis (TempleOS)
- toly (solana dev)
- armani (serum dev)
- dean (chief disrespecter)
- The Zig programming language
- Linux BPF system

## ⚡ Performance

Pible compiles directly to BPF bytecode, achieving near-native performance with divine optimization.

```
Benchmark Results:
HolyC on BPF vs Native:
- Computation: 1.02x
- I/O Operations: 1.15x
- Divine Efficiency: ∞
```
