# Risk Management Protocol Example

Comprehensive risk management system providing real-time portfolio risk assessment, monitoring, and automated risk control mechanisms for DeFi protocols.

## Features

- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Statistical risk measurement at multiple confidence levels
- **Portfolio Analytics**: Comprehensive risk metrics including beta, Sharpe ratio, volatility
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous portfolio surveillance and alerting
- **Risk Limits**: Automated enforcement of risk constraints
- **Stress Testing**: Scenario analysis and stress testing capabilities
- **Correlation Analysis**: Cross-asset correlation monitoring

## Risk Metrics

### Core Measurements
```
VaR 95%: Maximum expected loss over 1 day with 95% confidence
VaR 99%: Maximum expected loss over 1 day with 99% confidence
Expected Shortfall: Average loss beyond VaR threshold
Beta: Portfolio correlation with market movements
Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return measurement
Maximum Drawdown: Largest peak-to-trough decline
```

### Risk Categories
- **Market Risk**: Price movement exposure
- **Liquidity Risk**: Asset liquidity constraints  
- **Concentration Risk**: Single asset/sector exposure
- **Correlation Risk**: Asset correlation breakdown
- **Operational Risk**: Protocol and smart contract risks

## Building and Testing

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/pible examples/risk-management/src/main.hc
```

## Key Capabilities

- **Real-time Risk Calculation**: Continuous portfolio risk assessment
- **Automated Alerts**: Risk threshold breach notifications
- **Risk Limit Enforcement**: Automatic position size controls
- **Historical Analysis**: Backtesting and performance attribution

This implementation provides institutional-grade risk management capabilities for DeFi protocols and portfolio managers.
