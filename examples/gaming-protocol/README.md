class PlayerProfile {
    U8 player_address[32];     // Wallet address
    U8 username[32];           // Display name
    U64 total_experience;      // Lifetime XP
    U32 level;                 // Current level
    U64 total_earnings;        // Lifetime earnings
    U64 games_played;          // Total matches
    U64 games_won;             // Wins
    U32 reputation_score;      // Community reputation
}

// Tournament configuration and state
class Tournament {
    U64 tournament_id;         // Unique identifier
    U8 name[64];               // Tournament name
    U32 game_mode;             // Type of competition
    U64 entry_fee;             // Entry cost in tokens
    U64 prize_pool;            // Total prizes
    U64 max_participants;      // Player limit
    U32 status;                // Current state
}

// Individual match tracking
class GameMatch {
    U64 match_id;              // Unique match ID
    U8 player1[32];            // First player
    U8 player2[32];            // Second player
    U8 winner[32];             // Match winner
    U64 player1_score;         // Final scores
