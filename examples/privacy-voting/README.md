# Privacy-Preserving Voting

A sophisticated privacy-preserving voting system using zero-knowledge proofs to maintain voter privacy while ensuring election integrity. This implementation supports various election types and verification mechanisms.

## Features

### Privacy Protection
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Vote choices remain private using zk-SNARKs
- **Anonymous Voting**: Voter identities are cryptographically protected
- **Unlinkable Ballots**: Votes cannot be traced back to individual voters
- **Commitment Schemes**: Secure vote commitment with reveal mechanisms
- **Mix Networks**: Shuffle votes to prevent correlation attacks

### Election Types
- **Single Choice**: Traditional single candidate/option elections
- **Multiple Choice**: Select multiple candidates or ranked preferences
- **Weighted Voting**: Token-based or stake-based vote weighting
- **Threshold Elections**: Require minimum participation thresholds
- **Conditional Voting**: Elections dependent on external conditions

### Verification Mechanisms
- **Public Verifiability**: Anyone can verify election integrity
- **Individual Verifiability**: Voters can verify their votes were counted
- **Universal Verifiability**: Complete election process is auditable
- **Real-time Tallying**: Live vote counting with privacy preservation
- **Dispute Resolution**: Challenge mechanisms for questionable results

### Security Features
- **Voter Authentication**: Secure voter registration and eligibility verification
- **Double-Vote Prevention**: Cryptographic mechanisms prevent multiple voting
- **Coercion Resistance**: Protection against vote buying and coercion
- **Receipt-Free Voting**: Voters cannot prove how they voted
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All communications are encrypted

## Architecture

The voting system operates through multiple phases:
1. **Registration Phase**: Voters register and receive cryptographic credentials
2. **Commitment Phase**: Voters commit to their choices using zero-knowledge proofs
3. **Voting Phase**: Encrypted votes are cast and recorded on-chain
4. **Tallying Phase**: Votes are aggregated while preserving privacy
5. **Verification Phase**: Results are publicly verifiable without revealing individual votes

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/pible examples/privacy-voting/src/main.hc
```

## Usage

### Create Election
```bash
# Create a new privacy-preserving election
./voting-cli create-election --title "Board Election 2024" --candidates "Alice,Bob,Charlie" --duration 7days
```

### Register to Vote
```bash
# Register as an eligible voter
./voting-cli register --election-id 42 --proof-of-eligibility eligibility.proof
```

### Cast Vote
```bash
# Cast an anonymous vote
./voting-cli vote --election-id 42 --choice 1 --commitment commitment.json
```

### Verify Results
```bash
# Verify election results and integrity
./voting-cli verify --election-id 42 --verify-all
```

## Testing

The example includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Zero-knowledge proof generation and verification
- Vote privacy and anonymity preservation
- Election integrity and auditability
- Various attack scenarios and mitigations

Run tests with:
```bash
cargo test privacy_voting
```

## Security Considerations

- Zero-knowledge proofs ensure vote privacy without trusted setup
- Cryptographic commitments prevent vote manipulation
- Mix networks provide anonymity against traffic analysis
- Time-locked reveals prevent premature result disclosure
- Multi-party computation enables trustless tallying

## Integration

The voting system can be integrated with:
- DAO governance systems for organizational decision-making
- Government platforms for public elections
- Corporate governance for shareholder voting
- Academic institutions for student body elections
- Community platforms for decentralized decision-making
