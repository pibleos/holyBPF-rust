## Advanced Concepts

This section covers sophisticated techniques for professional Solana development:

### Cross-Program Invocation (CPI)
- **Program Composability**: Building modular program architectures
- **Secure Invocations**: Best practices for calling other programs
- **Data Passing**: Efficient parameter and return value handling
- **Error Propagation**: Handling failures across program boundaries

### Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)
- **Deterministic Addresses**: Creating predictable account addresses
- **Seed Management**: Organizing and validating PDA seeds
- **Authority Patterns**: Implementing program-controlled accounts
- **Storage Optimization**: Efficient PDA-based data structures

### Security Patterns
- **Access Control**: Implementing robust permission systems
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Preventing recursive attack vectors
- **Integer Overflow Prevention**: Safe arithmetic operations
- **Account Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization

### Performance Optimization
- **Compute Unit Management**: Optimizing instruction complexity
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimizing account data usage
- **Batch Operations**: Reducing transaction overhead
- **State Compression**: Advanced data compression techniques

## Production Readiness

Topics essential for deploying to mainnet:

- **Testing Strategies**: Comprehensive test coverage patterns
- **Deployment Procedures**: Safe upgrade and migration strategies  
- **Monitoring**: Program health and performance tracking
- **Maintenance**: Long-term program lifecycle management

Each topic includes production examples, security considerations, and performance benchmarks.
