## Overview

HolyC is a systems programming language originally created by Terry A. Davis. Our implementation extends HolyC for Solana blockchain development, providing:

- **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents common vulnerabilities
- **Memory Safety**: Automatic memory management for Solana programs
- **Solana Integration**: Native support for accounts, instructions, and PDAs
- **Performance**: Optimized for Solana's BPF runtime

## Key Features

- Native Solana account handling
- Built-in serialization/deserialization
- Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) support
- Program Derived Address (PDA) utilities
- Comprehensive standard library
