## What You'll Learn

Each program example demonstrates:

- **Production Patterns**: Real-world code structures and best practices
- **Security**: Comprehensive vulnerability prevention and access controls
- **Performance**: Optimized compute unit usage and state management
- **Composability**: Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) integration patterns

## Program Architecture

All programs follow consistent architectural patterns:

- **Instruction Processing**: Clean separation of instruction logic
- **State Management**: Efficient account data structures
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and recovery
- **Testing**: Full test coverage with edge case handling

## Getting Started

1. Choose a program type that matches your use case
2. Study the implementation patterns and security measures
3. Adapt the code for your specific requirements
4. Test thoroughly before deploying to mainnet

Each program includes complete source code, deployment instructions, and comprehensive testing suites.
